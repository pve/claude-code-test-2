# Planning Document

## Vision

This Flask web application serves as an enterprise-level foundation that demonstrates comprehensive development standards and modern tooling for Python web applications.

### Goals

- Enterprise Standards: Implement production-ready development practices
- Quality Assurance: Maintain 95%+ test coverage with comprehensive testing
- Developer Experience: Provide fast, reliable development tooling
- Scalability: Architecture that grows from simple endpoints to complex logic
- Security: Built-in security best practices and configuration validation

```

### Design Patterns

#### Application Factory Pattern

- Purpose: Create Flask app instances with different configurations
- Benefits: Testability, multiple environments, clean separation
- Implementation: `app/__init__.py` with `create_app()` function

#### Blueprint Architecture

- Purpose: Modular route organization and reusable components
- Benefits: Code organization, namespace separation, easier testing
- Implementation: Route modules in `app/routes/` with blueprint registration

#### Utility Layer Pattern

- Purpose: Shared functionality across the application
- Benefits: Code reuse, consistent behavior, centralized logic
- Implementation: Focused utility modules for specific concerns

### Security Architecture

- Headers: Comprehensive security headers
- Input Validation: Sanitization and validation utilities
- Configuration: Production config validation and secret management
- Environment Detection: CI/development/production environment awareness
