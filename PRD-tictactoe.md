# Product Requirements Document: Tic-Tac-Toe Game Feature

## Executive Summary

This PRD defines the requirements for implementing a single-player tic-tac-toe web game where users can play against an AI opponent. The feature will be built following Flask development standards with comprehensive testing and quality assurance.

## Problem Statement

The current Flask application provides basic web functionality but lacks interactive features. Adding a tic-tac-toe game will demonstrate:

- Interactive web application capabilities
- Session-based state management
- Real-time user interaction
- Game logic implementation
- AI algorithm integration

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- Game loads in under 2 seconds
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- Clear visual feedback for game states
- Intuitive user interface

### Technical Performance
- 100% test coverage for game logic
- Sub-100ms response time for game moves
- Session-based game state (no global state)
- Proper error handling and edge cases

### Quality Assurance
- All quality gates pass (linting, testing, security)
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Functional Requirements

### Core Game Features

#### F1: Game Board Display
- Display 3x3 tic-tac-toe grid
- Show current game state visually
- Clear distinction between player (X) and computer (O) marks
- Highlight winning combinations when game ends

#### F2: Player Interaction
- Click-to-place moves on empty squares
- Visual feedback on hover for valid moves
- Prevent moves on occupied squares
- Disable board when game is over

#### F3: Computer AI Opponent
- Computer plays as 'O', user plays as 'X'
- AI makes moves automatically after player move
- Implement minimax algorithm for optimal play
- Configurable difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)

#### F4: Game State Management
- Track current board state in Flask session
- Determine win/lose/draw conditions
- Score tracking across multiple games
- Game reset functionality

#### F5: User Interface
- Start new game button
- Current player indicator
- Game status messages (win/lose/draw)
- Score display (games won/lost/drawn)

### Technical Requirements

#### T1: Flask Blueprint Architecture
```python
# app/routes/game.py
game_bp = Blueprint('game', __name__, url_prefix='/game')

@game_bp.route('/tictactoe')
def tictactoe():
    # Render game page

@game_bp.route('/tictactoe/move', methods=['POST'])
def make_move():
    # Handle player move and AI response
```

#### T2: Session-Based State Management
- Store game state in Flask session (not global variables)
- Session data structure:
```python
session['tictactoe'] = {
    'board': [['', '', ''], ['', '', ''], ['', '', '']],
    'current_player': 'X',
    'game_status': 'playing',  # 'playing', 'won', 'lost', 'draw'
    'score': {'wins': 0, 'losses': 0, 'draws': 0},
    'difficulty': 'medium'
}
```

#### T3: Game Logic Models
```python
# app/models/tictactoe.py
class TicTacToeGame:
    def __init__(self, difficulty='medium'):
        self.board = [['', '', ''], ['', '', ''], ['', '', '']]
        self.difficulty = difficulty
    
    def make_move(self, row, col, player):
        # Validate and execute move
    
    def check_winner(self):
        # Check for win conditions
    
    def get_ai_move(self):
        # AI move selection based on difficulty
```

#### T4: Frontend Implementation
- Responsive CSS Grid for game board
- JavaScript for interactive gameplay
- AJAX requests for move submission
- Real-time UI updates without page reload

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Page load time: < 2 seconds
- Move response time: < 100ms
- Memory usage: < 10MB per session
- Concurrent users: Support 100+ simultaneous games

### Security
- Input validation for all move requests
- Session security (CSRF protection)
- Rate limiting on move endpoints
- Sanitized error messages

### Scalability
- Stateless design (session-only state)
- Database-free implementation
- Horizontal scaling capability
- CDN-friendly static assets

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- ARIA labels for game elements

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Foundation
1. Create `TicTacToeGame` model class
2. Implement game logic (moves, win detection)
3. Create game blueprint with routes
4. Session-based state management
5. Unit tests for game logic (100% coverage)

### Phase 2: AI Implementation
1. Implement minimax algorithm
2. Add difficulty levels
3. Performance optimization
4. AI decision testing
5. Integration tests for AI moves

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
1. HTML template with responsive design
2. CSS styling and animations
3. JavaScript interactivity
4. AJAX communication
5. Cross-browser testing

### Phase 4: Integration & Testing
1. End-to-end test scenarios
2. Performance testing
3. Security validation
4. Accessibility compliance
5. User acceptance testing

## Test Coverage Requirements
