## Implementation Summary

### Key Accomplishments This Session

#### Backend Core Implementation (100% Complete)
1. **TicTacToeGame Model** (`app/models/tictactoe.py`)
   - Complete game logic with move validation, win detection, draw scenarios
   - Session serialization support with `to_dict()` and `from_dict()` methods
   - Deep copy functionality for AI algorithm integration
   - 33 comprehensive unit tests with 100% coverage
   - Fixed complex draw scenario test with proper move sequencing

2. **AI Algorithms** (`app/utils/ai.py`)
   - Three difficulty levels: easy (80% random + 20% blocking), medium (strategic), hard (optimal minimax)
   - Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for optimal play
   - 27 comprehensive unit tests covering all AI behaviors and edge cases
   - Integration with TicTacToeGame model for seamless gameplay

3. **Game API Routes** (`app/routes/game.py`)
   - RESTful API endpoints: `/api/game/new`, `/api/game/state`, `/api/game/move`, `/api/game/reset`, `/api/game/quit`
   - Session-based state management for game persistence
   - Comprehensive error handling and input validation
   - AI move integration with human player moves
   - 25 integration tests covering all API functionality

4. **Enhanced Validation Utils** (`app/utils/validation.py`)
   - Added `validate_json_input()` function for API request validation
   - Integrated with existing validation infrastructure

#### Technical Achievements
- **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with model-view-controller pattern
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests (game logic + AI) + Integration tests (API routes)
- **Session Management**: Stateless API with session-based game persistence
- **AI Implementation**: Three distinct difficulty levels with proper game theory
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses and edge case handling
- **Code Quality**: Following Flask best practices and enterprise development standards
