### Pending Tasks

#### Phase 1: Backend Foundation
- [ ] Create TicTacToeGame model with core game logic (`app/models/tictactoe.py`)
- [ ] Implement AI algorithms with minimax and difficulty levels (`app/utils/ai.py`)
- [ ] Build game blueprint with API routes (`app/routes/game.py`)
- [ ] Update blueprint registration in routes init file

#### Phase 2: Frontend Implementation
- [ ] Create responsive HTML template (`templates/tictactoe.html`)
